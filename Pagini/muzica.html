                <h3>Doom metal </h3>
                <p>Doom metal is an extreme subgenre of heavy metal music that typically uses slower tempos, low-tuned guitars and a much "thicker" or "heavier" sound than other heavy metal genres.Both the music and the lyrics intend to evoke a sense of despair, dread, and impending doom.</p>
                <p>The genre is strongly influenced by the early work of Black Sabbath, who formed a prototype for doom metal. During the first half of the 1980s,a number of bands from England (Pagan Altar, Witchfinder General), the United States (Pentagram, Saint Vitus, The Obsessed, Trouble, and Cirith Ungol) and Sweden (Candlemass, and later, Count Raven) defined doom metal as a distinct genre. </p>
            
                <h3>Epic doom metal</h3>
                <p>Epic doom metal has a heavy classical influence. One of the main characteristics are the vocals; vocalists typically employ clean, operatic and choral singing, accompanied by keyboarding and drumming performed in a bombastic fashion in order to evoke an "epic" sensation. Lyrics and imagery are typically inspired by fantasy or mythology. Examples of prominent epic doom bands include Candlemass, Solitude Aeturnus, Solstice, While Heaven Wept, and Doomsword.</p>

                <h3>Epicus Doomicus Metallicus</h3>
                <p>Epicus Doomicus Metallicus is the debut album of the Swedish doom metal band Candlemass. It was released June 10, 1986 on Black Dragon Records. On its release, the album had a significantly different sound than other European heavy metal bands of the time, because of their use of operatic vocals mixed over slow and heavy guitar riffs. The album did not sell well on its initial release, which led to the group being dropped from the label during the same year. Since then, the album has been re-issued in several different formats. </p>
                <p>The album title Epicus Doomicus Metallicus is a dog latin translation rendering of Epic Doom Metal — the genre which the band helped pioneer and with which it is most commonly identified. Although he was actually a guest musician at the time of its recording, this was the only Candlemass album to feature vocalist Johan Längqvist until he joined the band, officially, in 2018</p>
                <p>Epicus Doomicus Metallicus' differs from other European metal bands who were known for "playing at breakneck speeds and screaming in a high-pitched frenzy". Candlemass' album features slower riffs and vocals delivered in a "baritone, operatic style".The opening song "Solitude" features lyrics revolving around themes of suicide and depression.</p>
